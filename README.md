# Levellers

This is the public facing project site for the work by Melissa Schwartzberg and Arthur Spirling on the Levellers. Specifically, their current paper 

### *The Levellers and Their Contemporaries in Context: 'Equality' at the Time of the English Civil War(s), 1638–1666* 

is stored here.  The abstract for that paper is

> We consider the evolution of Leveller thought relative to their contemporaries during the English Civil War(s). We compile a new data set of hundreds of 17th Century pamphlets to chart themes related to rights, elections and suffrage for a diverse set of thinkers for the period 1638–1666. We combine this with novel word embedding techniques trained on millions of Early Modern English documents to make statements about how actors of the time understood key issues of interest to modern democratic theory. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that inter alia (1) John Lilburne created the key rhetoric of “freeborn Englishman” but that its evolution is more complex than assumed; (2) the Leveller interest in "equality" is distinctively legal rather than "social" in nature; (3) this legal conception also extends to Leveller concerns with elections, but on this topic they become more aligned with their contemporaries over time than in the case of equality.


The paper uses a new dataset of Leveller pamphlets, and produces *a la carte* embeddings (in the sense of [Rodriguez, Spirling and Stewart](https://github.com/prodriguezsosa/EmbeddingRegression)) of the same.  These rely on a set of 17th Century parliamentary journals as a training corpus, courtesy of [Tom Paskhalis](https://tom.paskhal.is/) and [Toni Rodon](https://tonirodon.cat/)---see their paper, [here](https://osf.io/qgu9c).  

Given the period, the embeddings are in [*Early Modern English*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English) and are freely available to anyone who needs them. You can find them in [this gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oGCMSnmcZG-uxO-gxj3otyT8QXlhmTp8?usp=sharing), and we discuss how to access them below.  We simply ask that you cite our paper as something like
